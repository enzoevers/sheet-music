Undefined behavior

[Verse 1]

A hum beneath my skin.
A shimmer in the air, the colors start to breathe.
And leave.
The screens starts to dissolve,
Their lights, like a dream, whispering, cannot leave.

My senses,
start to bleed,
the edges start to curl.
Melting down in rippling patterns,
hearing, feeling, tasting.
I am the wave. 

[Chorus]

This was never forged to live.
Roaming night and day, instinct leads the way.

This was never forged to live.
[Say the next sentence in a talking way]
In the kingdom where order reigns, failure, will prevail.


[Verse 2]

Dissolving like salt in water,  self begins to fade. 
Boundaries bend, 
existence on parade.
A raw confrontation, 
beauty, fear, flame, self.

Alice warned me, but I dove in just the same.
Synesthetic whirlwinds, unsynced neurons, I think I went insane.
Staring into me are all the places I have fled.
I taste the sound of colors painting pictures in my head.

[Bridge]

[First round instrumental]

[Say the next sentences in a talking way]

Alice, help.
Wall, are laughing.
Ground, is fading.
Safe mode, off.

My, creation.
Destroyed, cohesion.

Reboot

[Chorus]

This was never forged to live.
Roaming night and day, instinct leads the way.

This was never forged to live.
[Say the next sentence in a talking way]
In the kingdom where order reigns, failure, will prevail.
