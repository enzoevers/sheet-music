[Intro] (Instrumental)
 
[Verse 1]
The sun barely claws its way up the horizon
The team assembled again in rebellion
Jenkins crashed, I really feel like dying
Just want work in peace, God knows I’ve been trying
 
[Chorus]
It’s the ritual where my order meets their chaos
It’s the room where all my code will be convicted
Designs delayed, the sprint’s on fire
We are walking on a wire
 
[Verse 2]
Coffee’s cold, the backlog keeps on growing
Every task is twice the size of what we’re knowing
Deadlines chase, but still the hours keep on flying
I just keep pushing through, though inside I’m crying
 
[Chorus]
It’s the ritual where my order meets their chaos
It’s the room where all my code will be convicted
Designs delayed, the sprint’s on fire
We are walking on a thin wire
 
[Bridge] (Instrumental)
 
[Outro]
One by one they speak, what’s been blocking me
Another dependency, please come back to me
